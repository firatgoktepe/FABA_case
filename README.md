## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Yarn package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or navigate to the project directory

2. **Set up environment variables** (REQUIRED for API access):
   Create a `.env` file in the project root with your OpenWeatherMap API key:

   ```bash
   # Create .env file manually with your API key:
   echo "VITE_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here" > .env
   echo "VITE_APP_NAME=Weather Forecast App" >> .env
   echo "VITE_APP_VERSION=1.0.0" >> .env
   ```

   ðŸ”‘ **You MUST get your own free API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)**

   ðŸ“‹ **See `ENV_SETUP.md` for detailed setup instructions**

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser

### Available Scripts

- `yarn dev` - Start development server
- `yarn build` - Build for production
- `yarn preview` - Preview production build
- `yarn test` - Run tests
- `yarn test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode
- `yarn test:coverage` - Run tests with coverage report
- `yarn lint` - Run ESLint

## API Configuration

The application uses the OpenWeatherMap API. For security reasons, the API key is now managed through environment variables.

### Environment Setup

- **Required**: You MUST create a `.env` file with your own `VITE_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY`
- **Security**: The `.env` file is gitignored and never committed to version control
- **No Fallback**: The app will not start without a valid API key in environment variables
- **Documentation**: See `ENV_SETUP.md` for complete setup instructions

### API Endpoints Used

- **Current Weather**: `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather`
- **5-Day Forecast**: `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast`

**Note**: We use the free tier APIs only. The OneCall API now requires a paid subscription.

### Getting Your Own API Key

1. Visit [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)
2. Create a free account
3. Copy your API key from the dashboard
4. Add it to your `.env` file as `VITE_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_key_here`
